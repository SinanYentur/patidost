# Sprint 1 Goals (2 Weeks)

## Primary Goal:
Achieve a state where a user can successfully register, log in, and see a basic, non-functional home screen. The core application structure, navigation, and authentication flow must be in place.

## Key Deliverables:
1.  **Functional Login & Registration Screens:** Users can create an account and log in.
2.  **Firebase Authentication Integration:** User accounts are created and managed in Firebase Auth.
3.  **Basic Navigation:** A bottom navigation bar is present, allowing navigation between placeholder screens.
4.  **Hilt Dependency Injection:** Core dependencies (Repositories, UseCases) are provided via Hilt.
5.  **Project Structure:** All new code is placed in the correct feature modules (`:feature:auth`, `:feature:feed`, etc.).
