## 🔒 ANDROID STUDIO AI ENTRY BINDING

All automated systems (Android Studio AI, CI bots, scripts)
must load documents in this order:

1. .constitution/ANDROID_STUDIO_AI_ENTRY.md  
2. .constitution/PIN_TABLE.md  
3. Linked constitutional layers  

Any process that does not start here is constitutionally invalid.
